	Framework : In Java we have more than 1 frameworks

		   e.g Hibernate,Spring,etc.
==================================================================================

	Hibernate Framework : The main aim of this framework is that it will replace 
			      the JDBC.

			    - The Bean class is also called as Persistent class, where as in JDBC
			      it is called as POJO class.

			    - In hibernate Bean Class, it is compulsory to have 1 minimum Integer 			      field, which will automatically created as a Primary Key for your
			      Table.

		   	    - The class which is going to connect with the table is called as 
			      Persistent Class.
				
			    - And hence we have to create a mapping file for that.
