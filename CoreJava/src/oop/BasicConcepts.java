/*
 * OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
 * 
 * There are 4 important pillars in OOP.
 * 
 * 1)Encapsulation 
 * 2)Inheritance
 * 3)Polymorphism
 * 4)Abstraction 
 * 
 * 
 * Encapsulation : It is wrapping of a class in a single unit.
 * 
 * e.g capsule
 * 
 * Class : It contains the data-members(variables) and member functions (methods,constructor,etc) which 
 * 			does some behavioural change.
 * 
 * Object : It is an instance of the class.
 * 
 * Why do we create an object ?
 * 
 * -> In order to access the member-functions/data-members of the class, we create an object of 
 *    the class.
 *    
 *    Lifecycle of an Object
 *    
 *    1) Creation
 *    2) Utilization
 *    3) Destruction
 *    
 *    
 *    e.g a Papercup.*
