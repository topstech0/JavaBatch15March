	Servlet :  it is a java structured file, which includes the predefined
		   methods i.e doGet and doPost

		: this methods are also called as service methods.

		: it is a Controller also known as the Business Layer.

		: it means that it will take the input from the presentation layer 
		  i.e front-end and forwards the request to the data layer.

	Lifecycle of Servlet:

		i)   init()
		ii)  service()
		iii) destroy()


	MVC ( Model View Controller) : separation of concerns.

		i) Model 	: it will handle the data part.
		ii) View 	: it will handle all the Presentation layer part.
		iii) Controller : it will handle all the Business layer part.

	JSP : Java Server Pages.

	    : it is the view/front part in mvc.

	    : Like html is also a front-part.

	    : But in html we cannot write the java code.
	
	    : whereas in jsp, we can write the java code.


	To write java code, it uses 3 predefined tags.

	1) scriptlet tag  :  <%--java code-- %>

		- to write java code.

	2) expression tag :  <%= %>

		- to fetch the data from the data layer.

	3) inclusion tag. :  <%@ include file="filename.extension" %>
